The School Managaement system application allows student to be able to pay their fees during registration and the fee paid to the school will be the `SchoolToken()`

student can register by calling the function `registerStudent()`

You can get all the students by calling the function `getAllStudents()`

only the owner can register staff by calling the function `registerStaff()` and also authorize payment by calling the function `payStaff()`

to view the staff list you call the function `getAllStaff()`

Note:
**During the cause of the assignment, I used Remix IDE to test if my functions are working as intended, hence I've not written the test yet on foundry, but will update the readme once it's done**
